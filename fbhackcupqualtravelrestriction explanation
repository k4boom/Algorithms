Here is a official brief for the problem:
As a consulting data scientist in the airline industry, your job is to determine which trips between the various countries are possible.
Flights are only available from country ii to country jj if and only if |i - j| = 1∣i−j∣=1.
Let P_{i,j}P 
i,j

​	  = "Y" if it's possible to travel from country ii to country jj via a sequence of 0 or more flights (which may pass through other countries along the way), and P_{i,j}P 
i,j
​	  = "N" otherwise. Note that P_{i,i}P 
i,i
​	  is always 'Y'. Output this N∗N matrix of characters.
